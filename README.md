⚠️ **Note:** The Tabbied project is undergoing modernization and redesign. The API may change over the next few months.

Tabbied lets you easily create timeless and beautifully generated patterns or pattern to use for wall art, websites, print materials and more. Under the hood, Tabbied uses <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">&lt;css-doodle /&gt;</a> to generate the patterns.

Try it at **[tabbied.com](https://tabbied.com)**.

## 📦 What's in this repo

Tabbied is an [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces) monorepo with two parts:

- **The website** (repo root) — the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app behind [tabbied.com](https://tabbied.com), where you browse, customize, reseed, and export the designs.
- **The [`tabbied`](./packages/tabbied) package** — the generative engine as a published, framework-agnostic library with an optional React component. The site renders every design through this package, so it doubles as the package's integration test.

## 🎨 Using the `tabbied` package

Render any of the generative designs in your own app:

```bash
npm install tabbied
```

```tsx
import { TabbiedPattern } from 'tabbied/react';
import { radius } from 'tabbied/patterns';

export function Example() {
  return (
    <TabbiedPattern pattern={radius} fit="cover" style={{ width: '100%', height: 320 }} />
  );
}
```

Presets are imported individually, so your bundle only includes the designs you actually use. See the **[package README](./packages/tabbied/README.md)** for the full API, the framework-agnostic core, and exporting to PNG.

### 🤖 Using Tabbied with an AI coding assistant

The hard part for an assistant isn't the API — it's picking one of the 222
designs, since the slugs (`cleat`, `gnomonwedge`, `karst`) say nothing about
what they draw. Point it at
**[tabbied.com/llms-full.txt](https://tabbied.com/llms-full.txt)**: the API
contract plus a one-line description of every design, in a single fetch.

| File | For |
| --- | --- |
| [`/llms.txt`](https://tabbied.com/llms.txt) | The [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) index — a short pointer to everything below. |
| [`/llms-full.txt`](https://tabbied.com/llms-full.txt) | The full API contract and a one-line entry for all 222 designs (~31 KB). |
| [`/catalog.json`](https://tabbied.com/catalog.json) | Structured per-design data: palette, options and accepted values, default fit, SVG-export support. Also shipped in the package as `tabbied/catalog.json`. |

All three are generated at build time from the same `patterns/*.json` the
package is built from ([`scripts/generate-llms.mjs`](./scripts/generate-llms.mjs)),
so they can't drift from what's published.

## 🚀 Developing locally

To develop locally, clone the repository, run `npm install`, and start the dev server with `npm run dev`:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/subwaymatch/tabbied.git

# CD into tabbied
cd tabbied

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server (builds the workspace package first, then starts Next.js)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The designs live as JSON in [`packages/tabbied/patterns/`](./packages/tabbied/patterns) — the package's codegen turns them into a typed module that both the site and the published package consume, so adding a new design is just a new JSON file.

## ✅ Testing

End-to-end smoke tests run with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) against a
production build:

```bash
# Install the browser once
npx playwright install chromium

# Build and run the e2e tests
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```
