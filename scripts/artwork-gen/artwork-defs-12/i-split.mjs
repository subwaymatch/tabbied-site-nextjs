// I. Split — one cut across the cell, with an ink either side of it.
//
// Where section A softens a boundary until it stops being one, this section
// keeps it: a straight edge, and the two inks it separates. The variety is in
// where the cut lands, how far it leans, and whether the two parts meet, miss,
// or leave a third thing between them.
//
// Neither of these butts two clipped shapes edge to edge — one leaves a
// channel of ground between the halves, the other stands a single shape on
// clear ground. One anti-aliased edge instead of two abutting ones is both the
// better drawing and the better export: abutting AA edges are exactly where a
// vector renderer and a CSS painter disagree.
