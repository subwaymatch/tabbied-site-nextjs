// H. Bar — marks assembled from plain rectangles.
//
// No clip path, no mask, no gradient: an absolutely-positioned pseudo-element
// with four offsets is a rectangle, and two of them are a cross, a tee, an
// ell, a pair of rails. It is the least expressive tool in the batch and the
// most exact — a rectangle exports as a <rect> with the same four numbers, so
// everything in this section sits at a flat zero against its live render.
//
// The section is about *placed* marks rather than fields: where a bar starts
// and stops, what it meets, and what is left between them. Section B has the
// repeating fields.
