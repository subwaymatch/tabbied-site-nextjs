// B. Rule — stripe fields. Pitch, duty, angle, phase.
//
// A repeating-linear-gradient used as a mask is the cheapest real drawing in
// CSS and one of the most exact things the SVG converter does: the whole run
// becomes one gradient with spreadMethod="repeat", so a hundred stripes cost
// what two cost and land on the sub-pixel positions the browser used.
//
// The variables are few and the results are not: how wide the rule is, how
// much of the period it fills, which way it runs, where in the period it
// starts, and whether a second field is laid over the first at another phase.
