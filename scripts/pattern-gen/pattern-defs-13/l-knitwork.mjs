// L. Knitwork — what a knitted face does, in the two ways it does it.
//
// Ribbing read end-on is a stripe with structure in it: a repeating gradient
// whose period carries two ribs and the groove between them, which no single
// on/off slot can draw. A sawtooth skyline is the other thing knitting does
// with a row, and that one has to be a polygon — a gradient can fade to a
// point but it cannot hold one.
//
// So the section is one design of each kind, and the shared constraint is that
// both keep their ground open: the stripe's gaps are mask holes, and the
// sawtooth's sky is simply outside the clip.
