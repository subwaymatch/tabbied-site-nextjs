// H. Sheer — the dotted grounds of net and lace.
//
// Tiled radial fields: a hard dot, a feathered dot, and a ring. The converter
// turns each tiled layer into an SVG <pattern> holding one tile, so a field of
// four hundred dots costs one gradient however dense the net gets.
//
// The pitch is where this section had to be careful. A dot far below a pixel
// at thumbnail scale is drawn by CSS and by a vector rasterizer with different
// rounding, and the parity sweep catches it as a whole-field diff rather than
// an edge one — the two finest designs here (Bobbinet, Tulle) ship coarser
// than first drawn, and on a 3x3 thumbnail grid, so their features stay whole
// pixels where the gallery shows them.
