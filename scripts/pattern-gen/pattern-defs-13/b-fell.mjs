// B. Fell — a rounded mass standing off the side of the cell.
//
// A `farthest-side` radial seated *on* an edge, so the disc is cut exactly in
// half by the side it stands on and reads as a headland face rather than a
// circle that happens to be clipped. `closest-side` could not draw it — it
// collapses to a zero radius the moment the centre reaches an edge — and
// `farthest-corner` would rescale the stop as the centre moved.
//
// The ink is a plain background-color under the mask, so a reseed morphs
// through the colour, and the sky is a real hole rather than a second fill.
