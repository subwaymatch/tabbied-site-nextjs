// E. Shirting — one stripe, four weights.
//
// A single repeating-linear-gradient per design, used as a mask over one ink,
// and the only thing that changes across the section is the ratio of rule to
// ground: a hairline on an open set, an even stripe, a dense rib, and cloth
// so nearly solid that only a pinstripe of ground survives. That is a weaver's
// distinction rather than a draughtsman's, and it is the whole section.
//
// A repeating gradient exports as a tiled <linearGradient>, so the count of
// stripes on screen is the count in the file, and the ground between them
// stays a real hole on a transparent background.
