// S. Intersect — one shape cut by another, and only what they agree on left.
//
// `mask-composite: intersect` takes a list of mask layers and keeps the part
// every layer covers. It is the one CSS operator that makes genuinely new
// shapes out of old ones: two sectors aimed at each other from opposite
// corners leave only the lens where they cross, which no single gradient or
// clip path can draw.
//
// The converter nests one <mask> inside the next, which is the correct
// reading, so what comes out is exactly what CSS composited — including the
// holes, which stay holes on a transparent background.
