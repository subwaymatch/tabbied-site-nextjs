// D. Drybrush — a ruled field with a ramp laid over it.
//
// The same intersection as section C with a stripe field in place of the dot
// field, and it behaves like a loaded brush running out: the rules stay the
// same width all the way across, but less and less of them survives, until the
// far end of the stroke is bare ground.
//
// Which way the ramp runs against the rules is the whole variety of the
// section: square across upright rules, and square across rules that lean at
// forty-five degrees.
