// keeps worker/env.ts as the source of truth instead, because it records which
// secrets are *optional* and what each one degrades to when absent, which a
// generated file cannot say. So the two are bridged here rather than one being
// replaced by the other: a binding added to worker/env.ts is immediately
// visible to every test, and a binding renamed there breaks them at compile
// time.
