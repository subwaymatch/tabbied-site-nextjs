// the site is :3000 and the Worker is :8787. In production they are the same
// origin, and the client infers it from `window.location` with better-auth's
// own default basePath, which is the `/api/auth` the Worker mounts.
//
// Passing a relative `/api/auth` instead would look equivalent and is not: the
// client validates the URL at construction, and construction happens at module
// scope — during the static export, where there is no origin to resolve it
// against. That threw the whole prerender of every page importing this.

 *
 * Rather than sprinkle casts at every call site, the narrowing happens once,
 * here, against the shape above. If the session ever grows a field the UI
 * needs, this type is the one place to add it.
