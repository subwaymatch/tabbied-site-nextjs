// Brand copy: the three strings every small-business site needs, and the
// mapping from them onto a particular template's slots.
//
// A template spec describes slots by *id*, and those ids are local to the page
// that declares them — `brand.name` on the five shared TemplateSite pages,
// `bar.mark` or `colophon.colophonMark` on the bespoke ones, because 52 of
// them were annotated by codemod from whatever the component happened to be
// called. So an id is not something a caller can address a template by.
//
// A *role* is. `data-edit-copy="brandName"` marks the slot that holds the
// business's name whatever the surrounding component is named, the generator
// carries it into the spec, and a caller that has three strings and no idea
// which template it is talking to can place them. That is the whole of what
// this module does; everything downstream is `planEdits`.
//
// Why only three: they are the three a generated direction actually authors
// (worker/ai/schema.ts), and they are the three that are unambiguous on every
// template. A body-copy or section-heading role would have to pick between a
// dozen candidates per page and would be guessing.
