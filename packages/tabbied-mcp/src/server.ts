// A *factory*, not an instance, because MCP v2 is stateless — the SDK builds
// one server per request (per connection, on stdio) rather than keeping a
// session alive. Nothing here may capture per-request state.

/**
 * Register a toolset onto a fresh `McpServer`.
 *
 * Tool schemas stay plain JSON Schema — `fromJsonSchema` adapts them to the
 * standard-schema interface `registerTool` wants. That matters more than it
 * looks: `search_designs`'s enums are *derived from the catalog being served*
 * (see tools.ts), so they cannot be authored as static Zod and cannot drift
 * from what is actually queryable. Handing the SDK the schema also buys
 * argument validation for free — a bad enum value now comes back as a tool
 * error naming the allowed values instead of silently matching nothing.
